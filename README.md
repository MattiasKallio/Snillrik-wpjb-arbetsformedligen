# Snillrik-wpjb-arbetsformedligen
 A plugin to find and add jobs from Arbetförmedlingen to WPJobBoard

 Install like any other WP plugin. 

 Do some setting on SNIM Settings page, get token from Arbetförmedlingen API etc.

 Find the SNIM page and search for jobs. 

 There is a short clip in swedish here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UPFcWhVSuU 

I'm not really maintaing this plugin, but it should work unless AF rebuild their API again. But if you have any problems or questions feel free to contact med via https://github.com/MattiasKallio/Snillrik-wpjb-arbetsformedligen .
